################################################## ########################
DISCLAIMER: Re-Loader, Office Pre-Activation Pack, OEM Logo Pack.

This program was not created so that "the end user" can benefit
it without possessing the necessary licenses and original of its software.
R @ 1n, however, believes that all should have the possibility to test it and to have
a backup of your licenses.

Also, it does not justify in any way the distribution of this program,
in other words do not justify the spread at any website, or P2P
in any other public place.
I ask that these releases are not popular at all.

R @ 1n I have nothing to do with the distribution of this
program, it's all done by third parties.
According to the laws that belong to the country where I reside,
it is not my responsibility what others decide to do with
these versions. However, let it be said clearly:

"NOT condone in any way the sale or distribution
of this program, this was never my intention. "

R @ 1n assumes no responsibility for any loss of data
or any errors that may occur in using these programs.
Keep in mind that you are using a third-party solution.

Note that the use of these software are legal in most
countries outside the United States, if and only if you have a
full copy of the program - so you can use these programs
for backup purposes, and only for them. It remains to be seen how
you are struck licensing agreements with the (EULA).
They can not replace national laws, remember that.

According to the "DMCA ACT" members of the United States, you do not have
rights to circumvent a copy protection. Attention, if
are using this software in an illegal manner, the maximum penalty
that you have you are equal to that you would steal the shrinkwrapped software
in a mall. Although the basic operation of R @ 1n does not reside
in the United States, and so I'm not tied to
The laws of the United States as:

* No Electronic Theft Act
* Digital Millenium Copyright Act
* The Patriot Act
* "Other laws of the United States"

You should always buy the software you use, or in place,
use open-source programs.

This Software NOT encourages piracy, which is an act UNLAWFUL,
as well as being a lack of respect towards those who dedicate time and effort
application development.

I do not assume responsibility for improper use,
that is NOT dedicated to a vision to study educational or informative.
With this I can tell you that I dedicate myself to NOT piracy in any way,
I care only to share and investigate all forms of system and evasion.

I disagree, in any form, software piracy and NOT
responsible for a eventale inappropriate or illegal use.
